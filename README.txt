This is a simple tool made to make calculating and generating the small sort breakdown every hour quicker and more efficient.

If you're going to use the "Staff Cuts" section you do not have to include a total cuts count but if you're not making any cuts yet you must include the total cuts or it won't calculate and generate a response correct.
